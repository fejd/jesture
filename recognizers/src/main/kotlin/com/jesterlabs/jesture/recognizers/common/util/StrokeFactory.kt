/**
 * Factory class providing predefined gesture templates for common shapes and symbols.
 *
 * This class provides point data for 16 standard gesture templates that are commonly
 * used in gesture recognition applications. These templates are based on the original
 * $1 Unistroke Recognizer dataset.
 *
 * ## Available Templates
 * - **Basic Shapes**: TRIANGLE, RECTANGLE, CIRCLE, STAR
 * - **Symbols**: X, V, CHECK, CARET, ARROW, DELETE
 * - **Brackets**: LEFT_SQUARE_BRACKET, RIGHT_SQUARE_BRACKET, LEFT_CURLY_BRACE, RIGHT_CURLY_BRACE
 * - **Lines**: ZIGZAG, PIGTAIL
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 * ```kotlin
 * val factory = StrokeFactory()
 *
 * // Get points for a specific template
 * val circlePoints = factory.getStrokePoints(StrokeFactory.StrokeTemplate.CIRCLE)
 *
 * // Create a custom template from factory data
 * val template = Template("MyCircle", circlePoints)
 * ```
 *
 * @see StrokeTemplate
 * @see Template
 * @see Point

     * Each template represents a commonly recognized shape or symbol that can be
     * used for gesture recognition. The templates are based on the reference
     * implementations from the original $1 Unistroke Recognizer paper.
     *
     * ## Categories
     * - **Geometric Shapes**: Basic shapes like triangles, rectangles, and circles
     * - **Punctuation/Symbols**: Checkmarks, carets, arrows, and delete symbols
     * - **Brackets**: Various bracket and brace styles for programming/editing gestures
     * - **Freeform**: Zigzags and decorative strokes like pigtails
