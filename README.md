# jesture
Jesture is a gesture recognition library written in Kotlin. 

It currently supports the $1 Unistroke Recognizer, developed by <i>Jacob O. Wobbrock</i>, <i>Andrew D. Wilson</i> and <i>Yang Li</i>. For more info about the $1 Unistroke Recognizer, check out the [project page](https://depts.washington.edu/aimgroup/proj/dollar/) and their [paper](http://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/pubs/uist-07.01.pdf).

The library is under development and the main goals are:
* Support Java, Android and JavaScript clients with one library
* Add support for more gesture recognizers, such as 1Â¢, $P and $N
